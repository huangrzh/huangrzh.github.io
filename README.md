- rzhuang@gscaep.ac.cn

#### Requirements:
1. Strong research interest and motivation in condensed matter theory.
2. At least one of the following research backgrounds:
   - (a) Generalized symmetries (lattice or QFT, noninvertible/categorical symmetry)
   - (b) (Boundary/defect) Conformal field theory
   - (c) Strongly correlated quantum many-body systems (quantum magnetism, high-temperature superconductivity, SPT, topological order, etc.)
   - (d) Tensor networks (MPS/MERA/PEPS/TRG) or quantum information theory
3. PhD completed prior to appointment, with at least one peer-reviewed publication as a major contributor.

#### Offer:
1. Competitive postdoctoral salary and benefits in Beijing (postdoctoral apartment and research funding).
2. The research institute provides: affordable and tasty meals, ping-pong room, gym, yoga room, billiards room, reading room, etc.
